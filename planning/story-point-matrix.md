| SP | Effort Required | Complexity | Risk or Uncertainty | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5 | Minimum effort | Little complexity | None | Straightforward task |
| 1 | Minimum effort | Little complexity | None | Knows everything about the work item, no dependencies |
| 2 | Minimum effort | Low complexity | None | Mostly known work item with a few dependencies |
| 3 | Mild effort | Low complexity | Low | Adding a small feature with minimal dependencies |
| 5 | Moderate effort | Medium complexity | Low | Developing a medium-sized feature with some dependencies |
| 8 | Severe effort | Medium complexity | Moderate | Developing a new module with multiple components |
| 13 | Severe effort | High complexity | Moderate | Refactoring a large codebase with significant dependencies. **recommended to break down further** |
| 21 | Maximum effort | High complexity | High | Designing and implementing a new system architecture with high dependencies. **recommended to break down further** |
